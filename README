Overview
========

plow is a powerfull command-line tool for putting songs from your
music collection into a playlist. Most id3v2/ogg tag information
is used by plow to create a (sqlite3) database for filtering.
Additionaly plow supports fields like mood, tempo, language, etc.


How to compile and install
==========================

Requirements:
  * sqlite3 libs and excecutable (best is >= 3.3)
  * KDE taglib (1.4)

Download source code, then:
  $ tar zxvf plow-x.y.z.tar.gz
  $ cd plow-x.y.z.tar.gz
  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make install


Setting up and using plow
=========================

If you use plow for the first time you have to run setup.sh. You will
find it in the installation directory, usally /usr/local/share/plow or
/usr/share/plow.
  $ source /usr/local/share/plow/setup.sh

You can also do this without setup.sh:
  $ mkdir ~/.plow
  $ cp /usr/local/share/plow/plowrc ~/.plow
  $ sqlite3 ~/.plow/plow.db < /usr/local/share/plow/plow.struct.no_id.sql

Then edit ~/.plow/plowrc and change at least path, playlist and player0
settings under [general] section.

Run:
  $ plow -I /path/to/music
to fill the database. This may take a long time.

Thats it now you can try:
  $ plow --help
or just create a playlist containing all files
  $ plow
