Overview
========

plow is a powerfull command-line tool for putting songs from your
music collection into a playlist. Most id3v2/vorbis tag information
is used by plow to create a (sqlite3) database for filtering.
Additionaly plow supports fields like mood, language, etc.


How to compile and install
==========================

Requirements:
  * sqlite3 libs (best is >= 3.3)
  * KDE taglib (1.4)

Download source code, then:
  $ tar zxvf plow-x.y.z.tar.gz
  $ cd plow-x.y.z
  $ make
  (and as root):
  $ make install

Notes:
  * If you want to optimize your build of plow use
    CXXFLAGS, e.g.
    	$ CXXFLAGS="-O2 -march=pentium4" make
  * If you want to install plow into another directory
    than /usr/local/ change PREFIX in Makefile.


Setting up and using plow
=========================

If you use plow for the first time, plow creates
~/.plow/plow.conf and ~/.plow/plow.sqlite.

Then edit ~/.plow/plow.conf and change at least path and player0
settings under [general] section. If you use Ogg/Vorbis files it is
recommanded to change also the field names under [vorbis] section.

Run:
  $ plow -I /path/to/music
to fill the database. This may take a long time.

Thats it now you can try:
  $ plow --help
or just create a playlist containing all files
  $ plow


Documentation
=============

You will find actual documentation on http://plow.projekt182.de
or take a look at the man page:
  $ man ./plow.1
or
  $ man plow
if you already installed plow.
